# DARK POOLS/FX 2017
+ To run the case, do 
>./run.sh i
for `i = 0 1 2`. This will start mangocore with a 5-second delay, and launch a web UI.
+ Do not make changes to the `utils/` or `samples/` folders, these will not be accessible to you on the day of the competition.
+ Recall that you will not be able to click trade; you can develop a bot using the TradersBot API. A sample bot has been provided for you in the `samples/dev_bot.py` file. You can also look in `utils/bot.py` to see the bot that will drive the price path in the dark pools. Note that this bot will have a very negative P&L. Documentation can be found [online!](http://mangocore-client.readthedocs.io/) 
+ While working locally, initialize the bot with the host IP `127.0.0.1`. Log in with the user: `trader0`, pw: `trader0`. 
+ You can run your bot as soon as mangocore has started (the upper bar of the web UI will change from orange to green).
+ Read the case packet for information and strategies! Changes may be made to the case packet up until the deadline for submitting code, and we will keep you informed if anything changes.
+ We are going to require you to submit your algorithms ONE WEEK before the competition occurs (11/4/17)! Please make sure you have a working strategy by this date.
+ Best of luck!

# CASE UPDATES
+ 10/25: Case closeout should work now, and windows batch file has minor changes that should make it function as expected
