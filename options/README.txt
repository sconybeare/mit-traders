This folder contains mangocore binaries for windows, osx, and linux, as well as 3 15-minute sample cases for options: main0/1/2.json. 

To run the the first sample case main0.json on mac, you would run:
./mangocore-osx-amd64.x --case main0.json
And modify the command accordingly for windows/linux to use the appropriate binaries. 

Note that you will not be allowed to click trade on the options case. 
For instructions on writing and running a bot, see the information in the dark pools case; the mechanics for writing and running the bot will be the same. 
You just need to change the names of the instruments you are trading, and come up with new strategies.

Refer to the case packet for background on options, to come up with your own strategies to implement in the options case. 
We reserve the right to edit the case and case packet up until the deadline for your code submission, but we will do our best to make as few changes as possible. 

Finally, please keep in mind that you must submit the code for your algorithm a week in advance of the competition. 

Best of luck on the options case.
